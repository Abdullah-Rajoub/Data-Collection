Class sessions are conducted in workshop mode and employ cases and hands-on exercises to reinforce the key ideas, e.g., identifying customer needs, methodologies for the generation and selection of concepts, product architecture, industrial design, design-for-manufacturing, and product economic analysis.",

    "completion": "This course introduces fundamental quantitative methods used to analyze and solve various models of business problems. The course presents a set of fundamental theories and concepts including probability theory, time series, mathematical programming, and Markov processes. Such tools are then used model and solve a variety of business problems in finance, transportation, inventory management, etc. The course aims to equip the student with the necessary knowledge and skills allowing them to perform quantitative analysis to solve some business models including forecasting, distribution, transportation, and inventory models. After completing this course, students are expected to use software tools to solve these common management problems as well as constrained optimization problems. Students will gain some experience in applying these quantitative tools to real-world problems.",
