# Undergraduate study follows the academic level system.
# Undergraduate study comprises a minimum of eight levels.
# The duration of an academic level is one semester.
# Students are promoted successively from one academic level to another, in accordance with the promotion rules.
# The Rules of Implementation for Article 5
# The student is responsible for understanding and following academic rules and regulations including graduation requirements. Guidance and assistance from academic advisors does not relieve the student of this responsibility. Therefore, every student should be thoroughly familiar with all academic regulations pertaining to the granting of academic degrees. He/She regularly should familiarize him/herself with new academic regulations; in this regard he/she may consult the department chairman or the academic advisor regarding these regulations.
# The financial rules and regulations stated in Appendix D must be followed.
# The University assigns an academic advisor to each student for assistance in matters that relate to academic progress, such as:
# Selecting the academic major that best suits the studentâ€™s preferences and capabilities.
# Understanding and interpreting the academic regulations.
# Informing the student of the sequence of the required and elective courses and suggesting suitable elective courses.
# Following up on the academic progress of the student.
# Assisting in early registration and the various stages of registration.
# Assisting in course substitution, if and when necessary.
# The academic advisor is chosen from the faculty members of the department or the college. The academic advisor for the PYP students is the director of the PYP or someone appointed by him/her or acting on his/her behalf.
